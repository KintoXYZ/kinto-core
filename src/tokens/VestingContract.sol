/**
 * @title VestingContract - To be deployed on ETH mainnet
 * Created following OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v5.0.0) (finance/VestingWallet.sol)
 *
 * @dev A vesting wallet is an ownable contract that can receive  ERC-20 tokens, and release these
 * assets to "beneficiary", according to a vesting schedule and a mandatory one-year lock.
 *
 * Any assets transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning.
 * Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly)
 * be immediately releasable.
 *
 * By setting the duration to 0, one can configure this contract to behave like an asset timelock that hold tokens for
 * a beneficiary until a specified time + lock time.
 *
